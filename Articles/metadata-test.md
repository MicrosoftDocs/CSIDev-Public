# VS Code Authoring Extension

The VS Code Markdown Authoring Extension for OPS is a proof of concept to provide authoring assistance to writers working in OPS and authoring for docs.microsoft.com. It includes several functions, including applying the default docs template to new Markdown files and generating a GUID, applying common formatting to strings, inserting links and images, and previewing content using your site's CSS.
